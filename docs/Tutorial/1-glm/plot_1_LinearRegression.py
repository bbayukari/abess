in linear regression with both simulated data and real data.

#
# Our package ``abess`` implements a polynomial algorithm in the following best-subset selection problem:
#
# .. math::
#     \min_{\beta\in \mathbb{R}^p} \frac{1}{2n} ||y-X\beta||^2_2,\quad \text{s.t.}\ ||\beta||_0\leq s,
#
#
# where :math:`\| \cdot \|_2` is the :math:`\ell_2` norm, :math:`\|\beta\|_0=\sum_{i=1}^pI( \beta_i\neq 0)`
# is the :math:`\ell_0` norm of :math:`\beta`, and the sparsity level :math:`s`
# is an unknown non-negative integer to be determined.
# Next, we present an example to show the ``abess`` package can get an optimal estimation.
#
# Toward optimality: adaptive best-subset selection
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# 
# Synthetic dataset
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# We generate a design matrix :math:`X` containing :math:`n = 300` observations and each observation has :math:`p = 1000` predictors.
# The response variable :math:`y` is linearly related to the first, second, and fifth predictors in :math:`X`:
#
# .. math::
#     y = 3X_1 + 1.5X_2 + 2X_5 + \epsilon,
#
# where :math:`\epsilon` is a standard normal random variable.

import numpy as np
from abess.datasets import make_glm_data
np.random.seed(0)

n = 300
p = 1000
true_support_set=[0, 1, 4]
true_coef = np.array([3, 1.5, 2])
real_coef = np.zeros(p)
real_coef[true_support_set] = true_coef
data1 = make_glm_data(n=n, p=p, k=len(true_coef), family="gaussian", coef_=real_coef)

# %%
# This dataset is high-dimensional and brings large challenge for subset selection. 
# As a typical data examples, it mimics data appeared in real-world for modern scientific researches and data mining, 
# and serves a good quick example for demonstrating the power of the ``abess`` library.
# 
# Optimality
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# The optimality of subset selection means:      
#    
# - ``true_support_set`` (i.e. ``[0, 1, 4]``) can be exactly identified; 
# - the estimated coefficients is `ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares>`__ under the true subset such that is very closed to ``true_coef = np.array([3, 1.5, 2])``. 
# 
# To understand the second criterion, we take a look on the estimation given by ``scikit-learn`` library:

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression as SKLLinearRegression
sklearn_lr = SKLLinearRegression()
sklearn_lr.fit(data1.x[:, [0, 1, 4]], data1.y)
print("OLS estimator: ", sklearn_lr.coef_)
# %%
# The fitted coefficients ``sklearn_lr.coef_`` is OLS estimator 
# when the true support set is known. 
# It is very closed to the ``true_coef``, and is hard to be improve under finite sample size.

# %%
# Adaptive Best Subset Selection
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# The adaptive best subset selection (ABESS) algorithm is a very powerful for the selection of the best subset. 
# We will illustrate its power by showing it can reach to the optimality.
# 
# The following code shows the simple syntax for using ABESS algorithm via ``abess`` library. 

from abess import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(data1.x, data1.y)

# %%
# ``LinearRegression`` functions in ``abess`` is designed for selecting the best subset under the linear model, 
# which can be imported by: ``from abess import LinearRegression``. 
# Following similar syntax like ``scikit-learn``, we can fit the data via ABESS algorithm.
# 
# Next, we going to see that the above approach can successfully recover the true set ``np.array([0, 1, 4])``.
# The fitted coefficients are stored in ``model.coef_``. 
# We use ``np.nonzero`` function to find the selected subset of ``abess``, 
# and we can extract the non-zero entries in ``model.coef_`` which is the coefficients estimation for the selected predictors.
# 

ind = np.nonzero(model.coef_)
print("estimated non-zero: ", ind)
print("estimated coef: ", model.coef_[ind])

# %%
# From the result, we know that ``abess`` exactly found the true set ``np.array([0, 1, 4])`` among all 1000 predictors. 
# Besides, the estimated coefficients of them are quite close to the real ones, 
# and is exactly the same as the estimation ``sklearn_lr.coef_`` given by ``scikit-learn``.

# Real data example
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Hitters Dataset
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Now we focus on real data on the `Hitters dataset <https://www.kaggle.com/floser/hitters>`__.
# We hope to use several predictors related to the performance of
# the baseball athletes last year to predict their salary.
#
# First, let's have a look at this dataset. There are 19 variables except
# `Salary` and 322 observations.

import os
import pandas as pd

data2 = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'Hitters.csv'))
print(data2.shape)
print(data2.head(5))

# %%
# Since the dataset contains some missing values, we simply drop those rows with missing values.
# Then we have 263 observations remain:


data2 = data2.dropna()
print(data2.shape)

# %%
# What is more, before fitting, we need to transfer the character
# variables to dummy variables:


data2 = pd.get_dummies(data2)
data2 = data2.drop(['League_A', 'Division_E', 'NewLeague_A'], axis=1)
print(data2.shape)
print(data2.head(5))

###############################################################################
# Model Fitting
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# As what we do in simulated data, an adaptive best subset can be formed
# easily:

x = np.array(data2.drop('Salary', axis=1))
y = np.array(data2['Salary'])

model = LinearRegression(support_size=range(20))
model.fit(x, y)

# %%
# The result can be shown as follows:


ind = np.nonzero(model.coef_)
print("non-zero:\n", data2.columns[ind])
print("coef:\n", model.coef_)

# %%
# Automatically, variables `Hits`, `CRBI`, `PutOuts`, `League\_N` are
# chosen in the model (the chosen sparsity level is 4).

###############################################################################
# More on the results
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# We can also plot the path of abess process:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
coef = np.zeros((20, 19))
ic = np.zeros(20)
for s in range(20):
    model = LinearRegression(support_size=s)
    model.fit(x, y)
    coef[s, :] = model.coef_
    ic[s] = model.ic_

for i in range(19):
    plt.plot(coef[:, i], label=i)

plt.xlabel('support_size')
plt.ylabel('coefficients')
plt.title('ABESS Path')
plt.show()

# %%
# Besides, we can also generate a graph about the tuning parameter.
# Remember that we used the default EBIC to tune the support size.

plt.plot(ic, 'o-')
plt.xlabel('support_size')
plt.ylabel('EBIC')
plt.title('Model selection via EBIC')
plt.show()

# %%
# In EBIC criterion, a subset with the support size 3 has the lowest value,
# so the process adaptively chooses 3 variables.
# Note that under other information criteria, the result may be different.
