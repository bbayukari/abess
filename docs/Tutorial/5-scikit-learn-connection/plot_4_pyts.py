================================
Work with pyts
================================
``pyts`` is a Python package dedicated to time series classification. It aims to make time series classification 
easily accessible by providing preprocessing and utility tools, and implementations of several time series 
classification algorithms. In this example, we will mainly focus on the shapelets-based algorithms.
"""

# %%
# Shapelets learning is a new primitive in time series classification. Shapelets are defined as subsequences of time series
# that are in some sense maximally representative of a class. Informally, in a binary classification task, 
# a shapelet is discriminant if it is present in most series of one class and absent from series of the other class. 
# ``ShapeletTransform`` is a powerful method implemented by ``pyts`` to perform shapelets-based feature transformation.
# Actually, ``abess`` also works well with shapelets-based methods. This example shows how to effectively select 
# discriminant shapelets with ``abess``.

# Learning shapelets with ``abess``
# """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
# To select discriminant shapelets, we first collect all subsequences with predefined length and step as the candidates. 
# Then we transform the original time series by computing the distance between them to each subsequence. Therefore, 
# the original time series are transformed to some ultra high dimensional vectors. Finally, we perform binary 
# classification and shapelets selection simultaneously with ``LogisticRegression`` implemented by ``abess``.
