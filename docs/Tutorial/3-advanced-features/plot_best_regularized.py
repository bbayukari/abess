Regularized Best Subset Selection

# %%
# In some cases, especially under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) setting or predictors are highly correlated,
# the vallina type of :math:`\ell_0` constrained model may not be satisfying and a more sophisticated trade-off between bias and variance is needed.
# Under this concern, the ``abess`` package provides option of best subset selection with :math:`\ell_2` norm regularization called the regularized best-subset selection (RBESS).
# The model has this following form:
#
# .. math::
#     \arg\min_\beta L(\beta) + \alpha \|\beta\|_2^2,\; \textup{s.t.}\ ||\beta||_{0}\leq s.
# 
# To implement the RBESS, user need to specify a value to an additive argument ``alpha`` in the ``LinearRegression()`` function (or other methods).
# This value corresponds to the penalization parameter in the model above.
#
# Letâ€™s test the RBESS against the no-regularized one over 100 replicas in terms of prediction performance.
# With argument ``snr`` in ``make_glm_data()``, we can add white noise
# into generated data.

# %%
# We see that the regularized best subset select ("RABESS") indeed reduces the prediction error.
#
# The ``abess`` R package also supports regularized best-subset selection.
